# Co-occurrence-network
This repository contains the R codes used for my undergraduate research on the topic "Studying the microbial community interactions of Sri Lankan milk microbiota under different environmental conditions".

The study involved construction and analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks of Sri Lankan milk microbiota.

The phyloseq.R file contains codes for loading and pre-processing of initial dataset.
Wet zone.R, Dry Zone.R, and Intermediate Zone.R files construct and analyze the microbial co-occurrence network for each zone.
